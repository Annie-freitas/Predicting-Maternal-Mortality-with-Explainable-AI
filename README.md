# Predicting-Maternal-Mortality-with-Explainable-AI


**Overview**

This project leverages machine learning and explainable AI (XAI) to predict maternal mortality, particularly among adolescents. The goal is to support early risk detection, optimize intervention strategies, and enhance clinical decision-making in maternal healthcare.

**Dataset**

1. Sociodemographic and clinical variables related to maternal health.

2. Focuses on adolescent pregnancy and maternal outcomes.

3. Preprocessing steps included handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and balancing the dataset.

**Models Used**

1. Logistic Regression

2. Decision Tree Classifier

3. Random Forest Classifier (best-performing)

**Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.**


**Explainability Tools**

To enhance trust and transparency:

1. SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) was used to identify globally important features.

2. LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) provided insights into individual predictions.


**Key Findings**
1. Random Forest outperformed other models in predictive accuracy.

2. Top predictors included: antenatal care visits, place of delivery, and education level.

3. Explainable AI enables better clinical interpretation and actionable insights.


**Impact & Future Work**

1. Highlights the role of XAI in improving maternal health outcomes in resource-limited settings.

2. Emphasizes the need for collaboration among data scientists, clinicians, and policymakers.

3. Future work will focus on improving data quality and integrating AI tools into real-world clinical workflows.
